# Coinbase Tax Collector

Coinbase Tax Collector (CTC) is a Python script that reads your Coinbase transaction history report CSV file, identifies all taxable transactions, and calculates your capital gains or losses. It allows you to select from among two accounting methods for calculating your tax responsiblity: Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) or First-In, First-Out (FIFO).

This project was developed using Python 3.10.
